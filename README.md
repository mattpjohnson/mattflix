## Challenge
Create an application that uses the OMDB API to display movie data. Movies can be searched using a search bar.

## Solution
I began by creating a short description of the pages I would be building.
I then created simple wireframes for these pages.

I wanted to make sure that the initial load screen displayed results, but I found that the OMDB API does not have an option for doing this.
To get around this I just hardcoded an initial search for the term `star wars`.
